But the moment we admit that information processing is the source of intelligence;
that some appropriate computational system is what the basis of intelligence is. . .
and we admit that we will improve these systems continuously; and we admit that
the horizon of cognition very likely far exceeds what we currently know, then
we have to admit that we're in the process of building some sort of god.  Now
would be a good time to make sure its a god we can live with.
